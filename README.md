## Introduction

This project has the intention to carry out analysis of the effects caused by Social
Sentiments on the financial instruments, in this case specifically Stocks. The aim 
currently is to use large datasets of Twitter and Reddit posts from financial subreddits 
to create sentiment values to compare against the stocks performance, this will be 
expanded upon with further social platforms where able.
